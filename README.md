# fscanOutput

### A small script for processing fscan output results (especially for optimizing output from fscan scans of large asset sets—**giving you a head start on tagging!!!**)

`python3 fscanOutput.py result.txt`

## Regarding the Update to Version V3.0

1. Optimize extraction rules for NetBIOS and NetInfo, extracting them into separate sheet lists to prevent missed matches.

2. Organize all TXT results into the target processing file directory to avoid clutter.
